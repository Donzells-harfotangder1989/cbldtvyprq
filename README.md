> Man, Phule — what even was that? Just staggered out of the theater, brain still spinning like an old CD. Popcorn everywhere, stuck to my shoes and one rogue kernel in my hair like it wanted to hitch a ride. Theater was a zoo, like everyone forgot how to whisper at the same second the opening credits started. 

I swear, halfway through, I felt that lead actor’s rage in my back, like a thousand tiny needles jabbing at just the right angle to make you want to stand but not move at all? Those scenes where they just stared — no words — and the camera kept zooming in. It was like they were unfolding a massive paper crane but I couldn’t see the whole picture. It reminded me of that dream where you scream and your voice is a rubber chicken sound. Something haunting about silence damn near louder than the chatters around me. 

> There was this... moment, or maybe it was a scene or several jumbled together, where I felt like it kicked me out of a story and into a sketchbook of someone else's mind. Why did the pigeons matter again? Made me think about the time Brenda got a pigeon stuck inside her hair at that concert — you remember, right? Wonder if she's seen Phule; she’d probably say something about the symbolism of it all. Anyway.

Oh, right! Forgot to tell Jackson to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  . It had that scene where you KNOW you have to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   in some weird midnight wish-telling group. I didn’t breathe for a span, probably caused my eyes to dry out until they felt like sandpaper. Beautifully chaotic, I'd 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 again just to untangle its spider-web-like logic. Every noise, every flicker — it felt like an off-beat drum solo played inside your skull.

And the ending? Like they tore out the last pages of a book and handed you a mirror instead. No idea what to do with that reflection, quite frankly.
